## Assignment 3 : discussion with Team Leads and project managers 

### Project Manager : Mr. Nabeel Amir

#### Project Title : VISiiO
This is basically a field management system (conduct the projects for clients and provide assistance). And it offers many services to carry out national or international projects.
##### Site : visiio.de
##### Technology used : Typo3
##### Requirements understanding : 
The main problem while initiating the project that there was no English speaking person , coeus team asked them to answer some questions whether verbally or written otherwise will not take that project , so a translator came in between and the problem resolved but that was a communication gap.
##### Challenges about quality and testing side : 
Due to lack of resources developers performed testing by themselves (poor testing) , and also that project was challenging due to responsive design requirement.
##### Requirements analysis and delivery side : 
When the product delivered to the client he identified many issues/problems , manly in moving from one screen size to other screen size.

#### Project Title : storexpo
Real state property dealing platform through which user can check out for the available property in a specific area and can sale/purchase, can take on rent or give on rent. 
Coeus hired an external developer for that project but that was a fixed priced model based project.
##### Site : storexpo.de
##### Technology :  Zend 2 Framework, Javascript, mysql

##### Requirements understanding : 
A long workshop was held in order to gather the requirements but even then some details were missed, actually the client was not clear about the requirements and continued to keep on changing so, charged accordingly
##### Challenges about quality and testing side :  
QA was very weak in that project, 2-3 QAs resigned one after the other, and many problems were arising. So, it was then decided to finish the QA in that project
##### Requirements analysis and delivery side : 
Currently all contracts are fulfilled but this client often comes up with new requirements and changes so, company charge him accordingly and make changes. 


#### Project name : olympia park
Olympic parks is actually a sports park in Germany. So, this web application provides information about sports events, exhibitions, music concerts, indore and outdoor sports schedules, news, offers, maps and tickets .etc.
##### Site : olympiapark.de
##### Technology : At first it was developed in android and IOS, then customer demanded the version in IOS7
 
##### Requirements understanding : there was not any issue while gathering requirements because it was already developed in previous version of the same technology.
##### Challenges about quality and testing side :  QA was not involved, developer performed testing by themselves.
##### Requirements analysis and delivery side : For the IOS7, developers team changed that previous project accordingly but after IOS7 launched the new technology IOS7.2 suddenly came in the market due to which a main module of the project crashed and so, is the rest of the project and the client blamed the developers for that (that they didn’t coded rightly) but coeus team ensured them that it was developed by senior developers so it is not possible. However the client agreed to charge for one day but the developer took 2 days to fix that problem.

It is a Travelling portal where People share their experiences with each other about their travelling, they give tips, upload videos and share images .etc.
##### Technology : PHP language and CMS is drupal
 
##### Requirements understanding : 
No any major issue in requirements gathering, details come by time while moving forward in development.
##### Challenges about quality and testing side :  
No issues at QA side but client is pointing out many issues and most of the issues are design related.

The biggest challenge about quality in this project is its complicated theme (while making integration with Drupal).  Well, there is not any issue at QA side that may be because the client has not checked out the delivered milestones keenly till now.

Not any issue in requirements analysis

### My opinion and suggestions :
By the discussion with project manager and team lead I’ve come to the point that the company urgently needs a technically sound QA team and latest test automation methods because it is now the matter of time, we can’t deliver such products to the customers which have quality issues.
And I also think that all requirements should be clear before starting the actual development of the project (I’ve observed that this approach is not currently being practiced in the company as told by Mr. Zaheer Abbass that the requirement details come by time when move forward in the development process)
